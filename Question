Write a program to implement following graph search algorithms in a directed graph. Assume that
the vertex ordering in a graph follows the natural number sequence starting from 0.
(a) Breadth First Search (BFS)
(b) Depth First Search (DFS)
Input Format:
• First line contains two integers n ∈ [1, 1000] and m ∈ [1, 1000] denoting the number of vertices
and edges respectively.
• Next m lines denote the pair of vertices representing edge.
• The last line contains the source vertex.
Output Format:
• Print the BFS and DFS traversal respectively in two different lines.
Sample Input:
4 6
0 1
0 2
1 2
2 0
2 3
3 3
0
Sample Output:
0 1 2 3
0 1 2 3
